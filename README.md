# GitHub ADO Linker
A Chromium extension for linking to MSFT internal ADO items from WinUI 3 GitHub issues

## How install
Currently, the only way to install this extention into Edge is to sideload it as an unpackaged extension.
1. Download the repo, or just the GithubToAdoExt directory.
2. Open the Extensions pane in Edge (this can be found under the ... menu in the upper right)
3. Ensure that "Developer mode" is turned on (bottom left corner. If it's not there, hit the hamburger menu in the upper left.)
4. Click the "Load unpackaged" icon
5. Select the GithubToAdoExt folder

The extension should now be installed, and you should see the WinUI logo in your Edge toolbar.

## How to use
- Go to the WinUI GitHub page you want to find the ADO item for.
- Click the extension's icon in the toolbar
- Click GetLink
- Click the link
If you are not on a WinUI GitHub page, you will see an error stating such.
